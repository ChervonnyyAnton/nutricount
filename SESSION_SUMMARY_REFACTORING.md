**Improvement:** +9% coverage, -78% missed lines

**New Tests Added (8 total):**

1. **Admin Decorator Tests (4 tests):**
   - `test_require_admin_no_token` - Verify 401 error without token

   - `test_require_admin_success` - Verify successful admin access

2. **Rate Limiter Error Handling (2 tests):**
   - `test_is_allowed_exception_handling` - Fail-open behavior on cache errors

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Test Implementation Approach
1. **Used Flask app fixture** from conftest.py
2. **Test request context** for decorator testing
3. **Mock patching** for external dependencies
4. **Proper cleanup** to restore testing mode after tests

### Code Quality Maintained
- ✅ All tests passing (553/553)
- ✅ Zero linting errors (flake8)
- ✅ Code formatted with black
- ✅ Imports sorted with isort
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Fast test execution (~27s)

### Files Modified
1. `tests/unit/test_security.py` - Added 8 new test methods (+337 lines)
2. `REFACTORING_STATUS.md` - Updated Phase 2 and 3 status
3. `src/constants.py` - Reverted unintended mutation test artifact

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Pragmatic Approach:** Identified Phase 3 as actionable while Phase 2 requires time
2. **Parallel Execution:** Phase 3 can proceed independently of Phase 2
3. **Quick Wins:** Targeted high-value module (security.py) first
4. **Systematic Testing:** Used existing patterns and fixtures
5. **Quality Gates:** Maintained linting, formatting, and test standards

### Challenges Addressed ⚠️
1. **Phase 2 Time Constraint:** 
   - Problem: Mutation testing requires 18-50 hours
   - Solution: Documented infrastructure readiness, proceed with Phase 3
2. **Flask Context Requirement:**
   - Problem: Decorator tests need request context
   - Solution: Used `app.test_request_context()` properly
3. **Testing Mode Bypass:**
   - Problem: Rate limiting disabled in TESTING mode
   - Solution: Temporarily disabled testing mode for rate limit tests

### Best Practices Applied ✅
1. Run tests frequently during development
2. Format and lint code before committing
3. Use existing fixtures and patterns
4. Document decisions and rationale
5. Commit focused, atomic changes
6. Verify no regressions after changes
