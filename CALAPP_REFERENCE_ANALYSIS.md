## ‚úÖ Summary

**Current State:** Nutricount has a strong foundation with excellent test coverage (844 tests) and core nutrition tracking features.

**Opportunity:** Add CalApp-inspired convenience features (voice, barcode, favorites) to improve user experience.

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 1 (Custom Goals, Favorites, Meal Templates) to provide immediate value with low complexity.

**Unique Position:** Nutricount already has features CalApp doesn't (Intermittent Fasting, GKI, Raspberry Pi optimization), making it complementary rather than competing.

**Strategy:** Cherry-pick CalApp's best convenience features while maintaining Nutricount's unique keto/fasting focus.

---

**Next:** Discuss priorities and start Phase 1 implementation! üöÄ
