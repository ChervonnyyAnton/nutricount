## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Targeted Approach**
   - Focused on specific uncovered lines
   - Added tests for missing edge cases
   - Improved coverage efficiently

2. **Test Organization**
   - Added tests to existing test classes
   - Followed established patterns
   - Maintained consistency

3. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Used pytest-cov to identify gaps
   - Analyzed specific missed lines
   - Prioritized high-value coverage

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated metrics immediately
   - Tracked progress accurately
   - Maintained documentation quality

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Example Functions**
   - nutrition_calculator.py has example functions (lines 1045-1158)
   - These are demonstration code, not production code
   - Low priority for coverage (cosmetic)

2. **Test File Linting**
   - Pre-existing linting issues in test files
   - Not in scope (focus on src/ directory)
   - Documented for future cleanup

3. **Coverage Plateau**
   - Some modules have hard-to-test edge cases
   - Decorators and error handlers need Flask context
   - Diminishing returns beyond 90%

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Incremental Progress**
   - Small, focused changes
   - Test after each change
   - Commit frequently

2. **Quality First**
   - All tests must pass
   - No linting errors
   - No regressions

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update docs with progress
   - Keep metrics current
   - Track changes accurately
