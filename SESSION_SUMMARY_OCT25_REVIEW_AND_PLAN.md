## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Mutation Testing Execution Approach
**Problem:** Mutation testing takes 18-28 hours total  
**Decision:** Execute locally, not in CI/CD  
**Rationale:**
- Each mutant requires full test suite run (844 tests)
- CI/CD has limited runtime and compute resources
- Local execution allows breaks and better control
- Results can be committed to repo after completion

**Implementation:**
- Created detailed Week 8 execution guide
- Scheduled for local developer execution
- No CI/CD integration required initially

### Decision 2: Focus on Practical Next Steps
**Problem:** Many tasks could be done, need prioritization  
**Decision:** Focus on E2E validation and mutation testing prep  
**Rationale:**
- E2E fixes already applied, just need validation
- Mutation testing is next major milestone (Week 8)
- All other priorities (1 and 3) are complete
- Clear path forward is more valuable than new work

## üí° Insights for Future Work

### Lesson 1: Time Estimation for Mutation Testing
**Insight:** Mutation testing is significantly more time-consuming than expected  
**Impact:** Original estimate was 8-12 hours, reality is 18-28 hours  
**Lesson:** Each mutant requires full test suite run (30+ seconds each)  
**Application:** Always run mutation testing locally first, not in CI/CD

### Lesson 2: Strategy vs Execution
**Insight:** Having a detailed strategy document (MUTATION_TESTING_STRATEGY.md) is valuable  
**Impact:** Clear targets and approach defined before execution  
**Lesson:** Invest time in planning before executing long-running tasks  
**Application:** Apply same approach to other major initiatives

### Lesson 3: Project Health Indicators
**Insight:** Multiple quality metrics provide comprehensive health view  
**Impact:** 844 tests + 0 linting errors + 87-94% coverage = confidence  
**Lesson:** No single metric tells the whole story  
**Application:** Track multiple quality indicators in dashboards

### Lesson 4: Documentation Organization
**Insight:** Moving from 85 to 16 core docs (with organized archive) improves maintainability  
**Impact:** Easier to find current info, historical context preserved  
**Lesson:** Regular documentation consolidation prevents sprawl  
**Application:** Schedule quarterly documentation cleanup
