## üìù Notes

### Key Decisions Needed
1. **Video Tutorials:** Decide if creating videos or just scripts
2. **Service Layer:** Scope for Week 6 or defer to Week 7?
3. **Advanced Patterns:** Which ones are must-have vs nice-to-have?
4. **Community Platform:** GitHub Discussions vs Discord vs both?

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Time overrun on documentation
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize user research guide, defer others if needed
- **Risk:** Scope creep on patterns
  - **Mitigation:** Keep patterns as optional, focus on documentation
- **Risk:** Community setup complexity
  - **Mitigation:** Use GitHub templates, keep it simple
