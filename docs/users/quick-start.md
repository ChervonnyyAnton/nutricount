## ü•ë Keto Diet Guide

### Understanding Keto Index
Nutricount calculates a **Keto Index** for each food:

- **90-100**: Excellent for keto (high fat, very low carbs)
- **70-89**: Good for keto (moderate fat, low carbs)
- **50-69**: Moderate (use sparingly)
- **Below 50**: Not ideal for keto (high carbs)

**Formula**:
```
Keto Index = (fat% √ó 1.0) + (protein% √ó 0.5) - (carbs% √ó 2.0)
```

### Net Carbs Calculation
For keto followers, net carbs matter most:

```
Net Carbs = Total Carbs - Fiber
```

Nutricount displays net carbs prominently in all views.

### Keto-Friendly Features
- üéØ Filter products by keto index
- üìä Track net carbs daily
- üî¢ Monitor ketogenic ratio (fat:protein:carbs)
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for keto-friendly foods
