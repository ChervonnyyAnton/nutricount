## 🎯 What is Keto?

The **ketogenic diet** (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that puts your body into a metabolic state called **ketosis**.

### Key Principles

**Macronutrient Ratios (Typical)**:
- **Fat**: 70-80% of calories
- **Protein**: 15-25% of calories
- **Carbs**: 5-10% of calories (20-50g net carbs per day)

### Why People Choose Keto

**Health Benefits**:
- Weight loss and fat burning
- Improved mental clarity and focus
- Steady energy levels (no sugar crashes)
- Reduced appetite and cravings
- Better blood sugar control
- Potential therapeutic benefits (epilepsy, PCOS, etc.)

**Important**: Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any diet, especially if you have medical conditions.

## 🔬 How Keto Works

### The Science of Ketosis

**Normal State (Glucose-Fueled)**:
1. You eat carbohydrates
2. Body converts carbs to glucose
3. Glucose used for energy
4. Excess stored as fat

**Ketosis (Fat-Fueled)**:
1. You limit carbs (< 50g/day)
2. Body depletes glucose stores (24-72 hours)
3. Liver converts fat into ketones
4. Ketones become primary fuel source
5. Body burns fat for energy

### What Are Ketones?

Ketones are molecules produced when the liver breaks down fat for energy. The three types:
- **Acetoacetate**: Created first
- **Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)**: Most abundant in blood
- **Acetone**: Expelled through breath (keto breath)

### Ketosis vs. Ketoacidosis

⚠️ **Important Distinction**:

**Ketosis (Safe)**:
- Ketone levels: 0.5-3.0 mmol/L
- Natural metabolic state
- Controlled by body

**Ketoacidosis (Dangerous)**:
- Ketone levels: > 10 mmol/L
- Medical emergency
- Usually only in Type 1 diabetes
- Requires immediate medical attention

## 🧮 Macro Calculator

### Step 1: Calculate Your Needs

**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**:

**Men**: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) + 5

**Women**: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) - 161

**Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**:
```
TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor

Activity Factors:
- Sedentary (little/no exercise): 1.2
- Lightly active (1-3 days/week): 1.375
- Moderately active (3-5 days/week): 1.55
- Very active (6-7 days/week): 1.725
- Extremely active (athlete): 1.9
```

### Step 2: Adjust for Goals

**Weight Loss**: TDEE - 20% (or 500 calories)  
**Maintenance**: TDEE  
**Muscle Gain**: TDEE + 10% (or 200-300 calories)

### Step 3: Calculate Macros

**Example** (150 lb woman, moderately active, weight loss):

```
Weight: 68 kg
Height: 165 cm
Age: 30
Goal: Weight loss

BMR = 10(68) + 6.25(165) - 5(30) - 161 = 1,381 calories
TDEE = 1,381 × 1.55 = 2,141 calories
Target = 2,141 - 20% = 1,713 calories

Macros:
- Fat (75%): 1,285 cal ÷ 9 cal/g = 143g
- Protein (20%): 343 cal ÷ 4 cal/g = 86g
- Carbs (5%): 85 cal ÷ 4 cal/g = 21g (net carbs)
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Eating Enough Fat

**Mistake**: Eating low-carb, low-fat = low-energy  
**Solution**: Fat is your fuel! Don't fear it.

**How to Add Fat**:
- Cook with butter, ghee, coconut oil
- Add avocado to meals
- Snack on nuts (moderate)
- Use full-fat dairy
- Dress salads generously

### 2. Eating Too Much Protein

**Mistake**: Excess protein converts to glucose  
**Solution**: Moderate protein (0.8-1.2g per lb lean body mass)

**Protein Portions** (roughly):
- Palm-sized meat portion
- 2-3 eggs
- 30g cheese

### 3. Hidden Carbs

**Mistake**: Not reading labels, underestimating carbs  
**Solution**: Track everything, read labels

**Common Hidden Carbs**:
- Sauces and condiments
- Processed meats (fillers)
- "Low-carb" products
- Restaurant meals
- Sugar alcohols (some count)

### 4. Not Drinking Enough Water

**Mistake**: Dehydration on keto is common  
**Solution**: Drink 3-4 liters/day

**Signs of Dehydration**:
- Headaches
- Constipation
- Fatigue
- Muscle cramps

### 5. Insufficient Electrolytes

**Mistake**: Not replenishing sodium, potassium, magnesium  
**Solution**: Supplement or eat electrolyte-rich foods

**Daily Targets**:
- Sodium: 3,000-5,000 mg
- Potassium: 3,000-4,000 mg
- Magnesium: 300-400 mg

**Sources**:
- Sodium: Salt your food liberally
- Potassium: Avocado, spinach, salmon
- Magnesium: Dark chocolate, nuts, supplements

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long to reach ketosis?

**A**: Typically 2-7 days of eating < 20g net carbs per day. Factors:
- Previous carb intake
- Activity level
- Metabolic health
- Individual variation

**Test**: Use urine strips or blood ketone meter.

### Q: Can I have cheat days?

**A**: Not recommended during adaptation (first month). After that:
- **One meal**: Might stay in ketosis
- **Full day**: Kicks you out of ketosis (2-7 days to return)
- **Planned carb-ups**: Advanced strategy (TKD, CKD)

**Better approach**: Find keto versions of your favorite foods.

### Q: Will I lose muscle on keto?

**A**: No, if you:
- Eat adequate protein (0.8-1.2g/lb lean mass)
- Resistance train 2-3x/week
- Don't over-restrict calories
- Get enough sleep

**Keto can be muscle-sparing** due to protein-sparing effect of ketones.

### Q: Can I exercise on keto?

**A**: Yes! Adaptation takes 2-4 weeks. Expect:
- **Week 1-2**: Reduced performance (normal)
- **Week 3-4**: Performance returns
- **Week 6+**: Often exceeds previous levels

**Tips**:
- Reduce intensity during adaptation
- Increase salt before workouts
- Consider targeted ketogenic diet (TKD) for intense training

### Q: What about fiber?

**A**: Essential on keto! Aim for 25-30g/day from:
- Leafy greens
- Cruciferous vegetables
- Chia and flax seeds
- Psyllium husk (supplement)
- Avocado

### Q: Can I drink alcohol on keto?

**A**: Yes, but:
- **Keto-friendly**: Spirits, dry wine, light beer (small amounts)
- **Avoid**: Beer, sweet wine, cocktails with mixers
- **Note**: Alcohol pauses fat burning until metabolized
- **Be careful**: Lower alcohol tolerance on keto

**Best choices**:
- Vodka, gin, tequila, whiskey (neat or with diet mixer)
- Dry red or white wine (1 glass)

### Q: Is keto safe long-term?

**A**: Research shows it's safe for most people. However:
- ✅ Extensive studies on epilepsy (100+ years)
- ✅ Growing evidence for metabolic health
- ⚠️ Individual variation exists
- ⚠️ Monitor health markers (blood work)
- ⚠️ Consult doctor regularly

**Who should avoid**:
- Type 1 diabetes (without medical supervision)
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding (consult doctor)
- History of eating disorders
- Certain metabolic conditions

### Q: How do I know I'm in ketosis?

**Signs**:
- Keto breath (acetone smell)
- Increased urination (first week)
- Decreased appetite
- Mental clarity
- Steady energy
- Weight loss

**Testing Methods**:
1. **Urine strips**: Cheap, inaccurate long-term
2. **Blood ketone meter**: Accurate, expensive ($1-3/test)
3. **Breath ketone meter**: One-time cost, convenient

**Optimal ketone levels**: 0.5-3.0 mmol/L
