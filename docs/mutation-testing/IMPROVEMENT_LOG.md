# Mutation Testing Improvement Log
**Purpose:** Track test improvements made in response to mutation testing results  
**Status:** Active  
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

## How to Use This Log

When fixing surviving mutants:
1. Document the mutant that survived
2. Explain why it survived (what was missing in tests)
3. Describe the test improvement made
4. Record the before/after mutation scores
5. Link to relevant commits

## Common Patterns

This section tracks recurring patterns in surviving mutants:

### Pattern 1: Boundary Value Issues
**Frequency:** _TBD_  
**Modules Affected:** _TBD_  
**Common Fix:** Add explicit boundary value tests

### Pattern 2: Null/None Handling
**Frequency:** _TBD_  
**Modules Affected:** _TBD_  
**Common Fix:** Add None/null handling tests

### Pattern 3: Error Path Coverage
**Frequency:** _TBD_  
**Modules Affected:** _TBD_  
**Common Fix:** Add exception scenario tests

### Pattern 4: Return Value Testing
**Frequency:** _TBD_  
**Modules Affected:** _TBD_  
**Common Fix:** Use explicit assertions (is True/False)

### Pattern 5: Edge Case Coverage
**Frequency:** _TBD_  
**Modules Affected:** _TBD_  
**Common Fix:** Add edge case test scenarios
