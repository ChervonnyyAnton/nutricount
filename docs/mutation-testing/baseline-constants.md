# Mutation Testing Baseline - constants.py
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Module:** src/constants.py  
**Status:** Partial Baseline (Interrupted)

---

## Executive Summary

Initial mutation testing run on `src/constants.py` was started to establish baseline scores. The process was interrupted, but provides initial insights into test coverage quality.

## Test Statistics

- **Total Mutants Generated:** 106
- **Killed Mutants:** 8
- **Survived Mutants:** 4
- **Untested/Skipped:** 94 (interrupted)
- **Mutation Score (Partial):** ~67% (8 killed out of 12 tested)

## Analysis

### Expected Behavior for Constants File

The `constants.py` module contains:
1. HTTP status codes (lines 5-9)
2. Keto index thresholds (lines 12-13) 
3. Nutrition limits (lines 16-19)
4. Meal/item types (lines 22-25)
5. Default values (lines 28-30)
6. UI messages (lines 33-58)
7. Emojis (lines 61-76)

**Key Finding:** Many constants in this file are **not actively tested** because they are:
- Display strings (success/error messages, emojis)
- Configuration values that don't affect logic
- Type definitions that are validated elsewhere

### Survived Mutants

The 4 survived mutants (IDs 9-12) are in the HTTP status codes section:

**Mutant 9:** `HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR = 500` ‚Üí `HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR = 501`

This mutation survives because:
- Tests may not explicitly check the exact status code value
- Tests may use generic error handling that accepts any 5xx code
- The constant might be defined but not actively used in tested code paths

### Recommendations

1. **Accept Survivors for Display Constants:** UI messages and emojis don't need mutation testing
2. **Focus on Logic Constants:** HTTP status codes, thresholds, limits should be tested
3. **Add Explicit Tests:** If HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR is important, add tests that verify:
   ```python
   assert response.status_code == constants.HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR
   assert constants.HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR == 500
   ```

## Target Score

**Recommended Target:** 85-90%

- **Achievable:** ‚úÖ With focused tests on critical constants
- **Worth the Effort:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Low priority - most constants are display-only
- **Priority Level:** üîµ LOW (per MUTATION_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Run:** Re-run mutation testing to completion
2. **Analyze All Survivors:** Identify which are acceptable vs. which need tests
3. **Add Targeted Tests:** Only for critical constants that affect logic
4. **Move to Next Module:** config.py (estimated 1-2 hours)

## Notes

- This is a warm-up module to build confidence in the process
- Expected time for complete run: 30-60 minutes
- Most survivors will likely be acceptable for a constants file
- Focus should shift to more critical modules (security.py, utils.py)

**Status:** Incomplete baseline, requires completion  
**Follow-up:** Phase 1, Step 1.2 (config.py) per MUTATION_TESTING_STRATEGY.md
