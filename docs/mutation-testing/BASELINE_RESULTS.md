## Critical Surviving Mutants

This section will be populated after baseline execution with details of surviving mutants that require test improvements.

### security.py (CRITICAL)
_To be populated after execution_

**Expected Areas:**
- JWT token validation edge cases
- Password hashing boundary conditions
- Rate limiting threshold tests
- Authentication flow variations

### utils.py (CRITICAL)
_To be populated after execution_

**Expected Areas:**
- Data validation edge cases
- String parsing boundaries
- Numeric conversion errors
- Date/time edge cases

### nutrition_calculator.py (HIGH)
_To be populated after execution_

**Expected Areas:**
- Keto index calculation edge cases
- Macro ratio boundaries
- Division by zero scenarios
- Negative value handling

## Test Improvement Actions

After baseline execution, this section will contain specific action items for improving tests:

### High Priority (Must Fix)
- [ ] _To be determined based on baseline results_

### Medium Priority (Should Fix)
- [ ] _To be determined based on baseline results_

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] _To be determined based on baseline results_

## Next Steps

After baseline establishment:

1. **Review Results:** Analyze mutation scores and surviving mutants
2. **Create Improvement Plan:** Prioritize test improvements based on results
3. **Update Roadmap:** Update INTEGRATED_ROADMAP.md with actual scores
4. **Schedule Review:** Set date for first monthly review
5. **Begin Improvements:** Start fixing critical surviving mutants
