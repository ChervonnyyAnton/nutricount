# 🎨 Design Patterns & Best Practices

Comprehensive guide to software design patterns and best practices demonstrated in Nutricount.

## 📚 Contents

### [Design Patterns](design-patterns/)
Classical Gang of Four patterns with practical examples:
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural**: Adapter, Proxy, Facade, Decorator
- **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method

### [SOLID Principles](solid-principles/)
Five principles of object-oriented design:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### [Best Practices](best-practices/)
Industry-standard coding principles:
- **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It
- **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself

### [Architectural Patterns](architectural-patterns/)
High-level system design patterns:
- Layered Architecture
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Clean Architecture
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
