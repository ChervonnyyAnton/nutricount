# 🔄 Automated Rollback Implementation

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Phase 2 Implementation  
**Priority**: Week 7 - Technical Priority 1  
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours

---

## 📋 Overview

This document describes the implementation of automated rollback functionality for the Nutricount GitHub Pages demo deployment. When E2E tests fail after a successful deployment, the system automatically rolls back to the previous known-good version.

---

## 🎯 Goals Achieved

1. ✅ **Automatic Detection**: E2E test failures are detected immediately after deployment
2. ✅ **Automated Rollback**: System automatically reverts to previous version on failure
3. ✅ **Loop Prevention**: Guards against infinite rollback loops (max 2 per hour)
4. ✅ **Clear Communication**: Automatic incident reporting and notifications
5. ✅ **Manual Override**: Manual rollback workflow still available for edge cases

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Deployment Flow with Automated Rollback

```
Push to main
    ↓
CI/CD Pipeline (test.yml)
    ├─ Test Job (lint, security, tests)
    ├─ Build Job (Docker build, health check)
    └─ Deploy Job (authorization)
    
    ↓ (on success)
    
GitHub Pages Deployment (deploy-demo.yml)
    ├─ Deploy Job
    │  ├─ Verify CI/CD Authorization
    │  ├─ Deploy to Pages
    │  └─ Create Version Metadata
    │
    ├─ E2E Tests Job (post-deployment)
    │  ├─ Install Playwright
    │  ├─ Run E2E test suite
    │  └─ Upload artifacts on failure
    │
    └─ Auto-Rollback Job (on E2E failure)
       ├─ Check rollback history (loop prevention)
       ├─ Get previous deployment commit
       ├─ Trigger rollback workflow
       └─ Generate incident summary

    ↓ (on E2E failure)
    
Rollback Workflow (rollback.yml)
    ├─ Validate Rollback Request
    ├─ Execute Rollback (deploy previous version)
    ├─ Post-Rollback Smoke Tests
    └─ Create Incident Issue
```

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### 1. Automated Rollback Trigger

**Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`

**New Job**: `auto-rollback`

**Key Features**:

#### Conditional Execution
```yaml
needs: [deploy, e2e-tests-pages]
if: ${{ failure() && needs.deploy.result == 'success' && needs.e2e-tests-pages.result == 'failure' }}
```

Only triggers when:
- Workflow has failures overall
- Deploy job succeeded
- E2E tests job failed

This ensures rollback only happens for post-deployment E2E failures, not pre-deployment issues.

#### Loop Prevention
```bash
ROLLBACK_COUNT=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/workflows/rollback.yml/runs?created=>$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)&status=success" \
  | jq '.total_count // 0')

if [ "$ROLLBACK_COUNT" -ge 2 ]; then
  echo "❌ Too many rollbacks detected - manual intervention required"
  exit 1
fi
```

Prevents rollback loops by:
- Checking GitHub API for recent rollback workflow runs
- Blocking if 2+ rollbacks occurred in last hour
- Requiring manual investigation to proceed

#### Previous Version Detection
```bash
PREVIOUS_COMMIT="${{ github.event.before }}"

if [ -z "$PREVIOUS_COMMIT" ] || [ "$PREVIOUS_COMMIT" = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ]; then
  # Fallback: use parent commit from GitHub API
  PREVIOUS_COMMIT=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/commits/${{ github.sha }}" \
    | jq -r '.parents[0].sha')
fi
```

Determines previous version:
- Uses `github.event.before` (commit before this push)
- Falls back to parent commit if not available
- Ensures we always have a valid rollback target

#### Rollback Workflow Dispatch
```javascript
await github.rest.actions.createWorkflowDispatch({
  owner: context.repo.owner,
  repo: context.repo.repo,
  workflow_id: 'rollback.yml',
  ref: 'main',
  inputs: {
    reason: `Automated rollback: E2E tests failed after deployment (commit ${context.sha.substring(0, 7)})`,
    target_commit: '${{ steps.get-previous.outputs.previous_commit }}'
  }
});
```

Triggers the manual rollback workflow programmatically:
- Uses GitHub Actions API
- Passes failure reason automatically
- Specifies exact commit to roll back to
- Creates audit trail

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Rollback Loop Prevention

**Problem**: If previous version also has E2E failures, could create infinite rollback loop

**Solution**: 
- Track rollback history via GitHub API
- Maximum 2 rollbacks per hour allowed
- Third attempt blocks with clear error message
- Requires manual investigation to continue

**Benefits**:
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Forces root cause analysis
- Maintains system stability

### 2. Deployment Validation Chain

**Pre-Deployment** (prevents bad deploys):
1. Linting (flake8)
2. Security scan (bandit)
3. Unit tests (pytest, 844 tests)
4. Docker build
5. Container health check

**Post-Deployment** (triggers rollback):
1. E2E tests (120+ Playwright tests)
2. Functional validation
3. User journey testing

**Result**: Only post-deployment issues trigger rollback

### 3. Previous Version Fallback Strategy

**Priority Order**:
1. `github.event.before` - commit before push
2. Parent commit from Git history
3. Manual specification in rollback workflow

**Fallback ensures**:
- Always have a rollback target
- No failed rollbacks due to missing version info
- Can override with manual workflow if needed

## 📊 Rollback Process Flow

### Scenario: E2E Tests Fail After Deployment

```
1. Developer pushes to main
   ├─ Commit SHA: abc123
   └─ Previous commit: xyz789

2. CI/CD Pipeline runs
   └─ All tests pass ✅

3. GitHub Pages Deployment
   ├─ Deploy succeeds ✅
   └─ Deploys commit abc123

4. E2E Tests Run (post-deployment)
   └─ Tests FAIL ❌
      (e.g., login broken, navigation issue)

5. Auto-Rollback Triggers
   ├─ Check rollback history
   │  └─ 0 rollbacks in last hour ✅
   │
   ├─ Get previous commit: xyz789
   │
   └─ Dispatch rollback.yml
      ├─ reason: "Automated rollback: E2E tests failed"
      └─ target: xyz789

6. Rollback Workflow Executes
   ├─ Validate rollback request
   ├─ Checkout commit xyz789
   ├─ Deploy to GitHub Pages
   ├─ Run smoke tests ✅
   └─ Create incident issue

7. Result
   ├─ Demo rolled back to xyz789 (working version)
   ├─ Incident issue created for tracking
   └─ Developer notified to investigate
```

**Total Time**: ~3-5 minutes from failure detection to rollback completion

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Test 1: E2E Failure Triggers Rollback

**Setup**:
1. Intentionally break E2E tests (modify demo HTML)
2. Push to main branch
3. Wait for CI/CD and deployment

**Expected**:
- ✅ CI/CD passes (unit tests still pass)
- ✅ Deployment succeeds
- ❌ E2E tests fail
- ✅ Auto-rollback triggers
- ✅ Previous version deployed
- ✅ Incident issue created

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check deployment version
curl https://chervonnyyanton.github.io/nutricount/.deployment/VERSION

# Should show rollback information
```

### Test 2: Loop Prevention Works

**Setup**:
1. Create two consecutive bad commits
2. Push both (or push twice in succession)
3. Watch rollback behavior

**Expected**:
- ✅ First deployment fails → Rollback succeeds
- ✅ Second deployment fails → Rollback succeeds
- ✅ Third attempt → Blocked with error message
- ✅ Manual intervention required message shown

### Test 3: CI/CD Failure Does NOT Trigger Rollback

**Setup**:
1. Introduce linting error or failing unit test
2. Push to main

**Expected**:
- ❌ CI/CD fails
- ⏸️ Deployment blocked (doesn't run)
- ⏸️ E2E tests don't run
- ⏸️ Rollback doesn't trigger
- ✅ Previous version remains deployed

**Result**: Pre-deployment failures correctly prevent deployment entirely

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Rollback Frequency**
   - Target: < 1 per week
   - Alert: > 2 per week (indicates quality issues)

2. **Rollback Success Rate**
   - Target: 100%
   - Alert: Any failures (investigate immediately)

3. **Time to Rollback**
   - Target: < 5 minutes
   - Current: ~3-5 minutes

4. **E2E Test Pass Rate**
   - Target: 95%+
   - Alert: < 90% (investigate flaky tests)

### Where to Monitor

1. **GitHub Actions**:
   - https://github.com/ChervonnyyAnton/nutricount/actions/workflows/deploy-demo.yml
   - https://github.com/ChervonnyyAnton/nutricount/actions/workflows/rollback.yml

2. **Issues Tab**:
   - Auto-created rollback incident issues
   - Label: `rollback`, `incident`, `priority-high`

3. **Deployment Version**:
   - https://chervonnyyanton.github.io/nutricount/.deployment/VERSION
   - Check `deployment_type` field

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### GitHub Actions Secrets Required

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
  - Used for: API calls to check rollback history and dispatch workflows
  - Permissions: `actions: write`, `contents: read`

### Workflow Permissions

**deploy-demo.yml**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
  actions: write  # NEW - required for auto-rollback
```

**rollback.yml**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
  actions: read
```

---

## 📝 Manual Intervention Scenarios

### When Auto-Rollback is Blocked

**Trigger**: 2+ rollbacks in last hour

**Actions**:
1. **Investigate Root Cause**
   ```bash
   # Check recent commits
   git log --oneline -n 5
   
   # Check E2E test failures
   # Go to Actions → Deploy Demo → Failed run → Artifacts
   ```

2. **Identify Pattern**
   - Is it the same test failing?
   - Is it infrastructure-related?
   - Is it a real bug or flaky test?

3. **Choose Resolution Path**
   - **If bug**: Create hotfix PR, test locally, merge
   - **If flaky test**: Temporarily skip test, create issue, fix test
   - **If infrastructure**: Contact GitHub Support, use manual rollback

4. **Clear Rollback Block**
   - Wait 1 hour for automatic reset
   - OR use manual rollback workflow (bypasses checks)

### Manual Rollback Process

**When to Use**:
- Auto-rollback blocked by loop prevention
- Need to rollback to specific older version
- Want to add custom rollback reason

**Steps**:
1. Go to Actions → "Rollback GitHub Pages"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Fill inputs:
   - **Reason**: Brief description (required)
   - **Target commit**: SHA or leave empty for previous
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Monitor progress in Actions tab
6. Verify deployment at https://chervonnyyanton.github.io/nutricount/

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Design Decisions

1. **Why 2 rollbacks per hour (not 3)?**
   - 1 rollback: Too strict, could be legitimate flaky test
   - 2 rollbacks: Indicates real problem, needs investigation
   - 3+ rollbacks: Definitely a loop, must stop

2. **Why trigger workflow instead of inline rollback?**
   - Reuses existing tested rollback logic
   - Maintains consistent rollback process
   - Easier to audit (separate workflow runs)
   - Allows manual rollback with same mechanism

3. **Why check E2E tests specifically?**
   - CI/CD tests (unit, lint) already block deployment
   - E2E tests validate actual deployed functionality
   - Only E2E tests can catch deployment-specific issues
   - Post-deployment failures are most critical

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Challenge**: Determining previous commit
   - **Solution**: Try `github.event.before`, fallback to parent commit
   
2. **Challenge**: Preventing rollback loops
   - **Solution**: Query GitHub API for recent rollback runs
   
3. **Challenge**: Permissions for workflow dispatch
   - **Solution**: Add `actions: write` permission to deploy workflow
