# üß™ Testing Guide for Workflow Dependency Implementation

## Overview

This document provides testing instructions to verify that GitHub Pages deployment correctly depends on CI/CD Pipeline success.

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal Flow - CI/CD Success ‚Üí Pages Deploys

**Objective**: Verify that Pages deploys when CI/CD Pipeline succeeds

**Steps**:
1. Make a small change to any file (e.g., update README.md)
2. Commit and push to `main` branch
3. Go to Actions tab
4. Wait for "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow to complete

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline should complete successfully
  - Test job: PASS ‚úÖ
  - Build job: PASS ‚úÖ
  - Deploy job: PASS ‚úÖ (shows authorization message)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" workflow should trigger automatically
- ‚úÖ Pages deployment should complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Pages workflow should show:
  - Link to the CI/CD Pipeline run that authorized it
  - Commit message that triggered it
- ‚úÖ Demo should be accessible at https://chervonnyyanton.github.io/nutricount/

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check workflow status via GitHub CLI (if available)
gh run list --workflow=test.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=deploy-demo.yml --limit 1
```

---

### Test 2: Failure Flow - CI/CD Fails ‚Üí Pages Does NOT Deploy

**Objective**: Verify that Pages does NOT deploy when CI/CD Pipeline fails

**Steps**:
1. Create a branch with intentionally broken code:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-failure
   echo "import non_existent_module" >> src/test_break.py
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test: intentionally broken import"
   ```
2. Create a PR to `main` or push directly to `main`
3. Go to Actions tab
4. Wait for "CI/CD Pipeline" to fail

**Expected Results**:
- ‚ùå CI/CD Pipeline should FAIL (at Test job due to import error)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" workflow should NOT trigger
- ‚úÖ No new deployment to Pages

**Cleanup**:
```bash
# If pushed to main, revert the commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# If in branch, just delete it
git checkout main
git branch -D test-failure
```

---

### Test 3: Linting Failure - Pages Does NOT Deploy

**Objective**: Verify that Pages does NOT deploy when linting fails

**Steps**:
1. Create a file with intentionally bad formatting:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-lint-fail
   echo "def bad_function(  ):  pass" >> src/test_lint.py
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test: intentionally bad formatting"
   ```
2. Push to `main` or create PR
3. Go to Actions tab
4. Wait for CI/CD Pipeline to fail at linting step

**Expected Results**:
- ‚ùå CI/CD Pipeline should FAIL (at Test job's flake8 step)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" workflow should NOT trigger
- ‚úÖ No new deployment to Pages

**Cleanup**:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

### Test 4: Build Failure - Pages Does NOT Deploy

**Objective**: Verify that Pages does NOT deploy when Docker build fails

**Steps**:
1. Create a branch with broken Dockerfile:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-build-fail
   # Add a line that will break the Docker build
   echo "RUN exit 1" >> dockerfile
   git add dockerfile
   git commit -m "Test: intentionally broken Docker build"
   ```
2. Push to `main`
3. Go to Actions tab
4. Wait for CI/CD Pipeline to fail at build step

**Expected Results**:
- ‚ùå CI/CD Pipeline should FAIL (at Build job)
- ‚úÖ Test job should PASS
- ‚úÖ Build job should FAIL
- ‚úÖ Deploy job should NOT run (depends on build)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" workflow should NOT trigger
- ‚úÖ No new deployment to Pages

**Cleanup**:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

### Test 5: Manual Trigger - Bypasses CI/CD

**Objective**: Verify that manual workflow trigger works independently

**Steps**:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. Select `main` branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Workflow should start immediately
- ‚úÖ Should NOT wait for or check CI/CD Pipeline
- ‚úÖ Should deploy successfully
- ‚úÖ Demo should update at https://chervonnyyanton.github.io/nutricount/

**Use Case**: Emergency deployments or demo updates without code changes

---

### Test 6: PR to Main - Only CI/CD Runs

**Objective**: Verify that PRs don't trigger Pages deployment

**Steps**:
1. Create a PR targeting `main` branch
2. Go to Actions tab
3. Observe which workflows run

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ "CI/CD Pipeline" should run on PR
- ‚úÖ "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" should NOT run on PR
- ‚úÖ Pages deployment only happens after merge to main

---

### Test 7: Verify Authorization Link

**Objective**: Verify traceability from Pages deployment to CI/CD run

**Steps**:
1. After a successful deployment, go to Actions tab
2. Click on the latest "Deploy Demo to GitHub Pages" run
3. Check the job summary

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Should see "CI/CD Pipeline Authorization" section
- ‚úÖ Should show link to the CI/CD workflow run
- ‚úÖ Should show the commit message that triggered it
- ‚úÖ Link should work and point to correct CI/CD run

## Automated Verification Script

You can use this script to verify the implementation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üß™ Testing Workflow Dependencies"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

# Test 1: Check workflow files syntax
echo "Test 1: Validating YAML syntax..."
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml'))" && \
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/test.yml'))" && \
echo "‚úÖ YAML syntax valid" || echo "‚ùå YAML syntax invalid"
echo ""

# Test 2: Check workflow_run trigger
echo "Test 2: Checking workflow_run trigger..."
grep -q "workflow_run:" .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml && \
grep -q 'workflows: \["CI/CD Pipeline"\]' .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml && \
echo "‚úÖ workflow_run trigger configured" || echo "‚ùå workflow_run trigger not found"
echo ""

# Test 3: Check success condition
echo "Test 3: Checking success condition..."
grep -q "workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'" .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml && \
echo "‚úÖ Success condition present" || echo "‚ùå Success condition missing"
echo ""

# Test 4: Check manual trigger
echo "Test 4: Checking manual trigger..."
grep -q "workflow_dispatch:" .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml && \
echo "‚úÖ Manual trigger enabled" || echo "‚ùå Manual trigger missing"
echo ""

# Test 5: Check authorization step
echo "Test 5: Checking authorization verification..."
grep -q "Verify CI/CD Authorization" .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml && \
echo "‚úÖ Authorization verification present" || echo "‚ùå Authorization verification missing"
echo ""

# Test 6: Check deploy job updates
echo "Test 6: Checking deploy job authorization..."
grep -q "Deploy authorization" .github/workflows/test.yml && \
echo "‚úÖ Deploy authorization present" || echo "‚ùå Deploy authorization missing"
echo ""

echo "=================================="
echo "‚úÖ All static checks passed!"
echo ""
echo "Next: Test with actual workflow runs (see test scenarios above)"
```

Save this as `/tmp/verify_workflow.sh` and run:
```bash
bash /tmp/verify_workflow.sh
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ Pages deployment triggers only after CI/CD Pipeline success
2. ‚úÖ Pages deployment does NOT trigger when CI/CD Pipeline fails
3. ‚úÖ Manual workflow trigger works independently
4. ‚úÖ Each Pages deployment shows link to authorizing CI/CD run
5. ‚úÖ Documentation accurately describes the behavior
6. ‚úÖ No disruption to existing CI/CD Pipeline functionality

---

## Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status

```bash
# List recent CI/CD Pipeline runs
gh run list --workflow=test.yml --limit 5

# List recent Pages deployment runs
gh run list --workflow=deploy-demo.yml --limit 5

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>
```

### View Workflow in GitHub UI

1. Go to repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Filter by workflow name
3. Click on specific run to view details
4. Check job summaries for authorization info

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pages deploys even when tests fail

**Solution**: Check the `if` condition in deploy-demo.yml:
```yaml
if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
```

### Problem: Pages never deploys even when tests pass

**Solutions**:
1. Check that CI/CD Pipeline workflow name matches exactly: "CI/CD Pipeline"
2. Verify branch name in workflow_run trigger: `branches: [ main ]`
3. Check GitHub Actions permissions in Settings ‚Üí Actions

### Problem: Can't find authorization link in Pages deployment

**Solution**: Check that the verification step runs before checkout:
```yaml
steps:
- name: Verify CI/CD Authorization
  run: |
    echo "**CI/CD Workflow Run**: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}"
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, rollback by:

1. Revert workflow changes:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Or manually edit `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
       paths:
         - 'demo/**'
         - '.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml'
     workflow_dispatch:
   ```

3. Remove the `if` condition from the job
