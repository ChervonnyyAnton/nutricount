## üö® Critical Post-Week 6 Items

### E2E Test Re-enablement (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current Status:** E2E tests are disabled in `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`

**Issue Summary:**
- 120+ Playwright E2E tests exist but workflow is commented out
- See [E2E_TEST_ANALYSIS.md](../E2E_TEST_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed analysis
- Tests were disabled due to CI infrastructure issues, NOT code problems

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Playwright Installation Issues**: Browser binaries failing to install in CI
2. **Server Startup Race Conditions**: Timing conflicts between manual and webServer startup
3. **Environment Configuration**: BASE_URL and server startup conflicts

**Action Plan (Week 7):**
1. **Fix Playwright CI Issues** (4-6 hours)
   - Update Playwright installation in workflow
   - Add proper browser dependency installation
   - Fix BASE_URL configuration conflicts
   
2. **Resolve Server Startup** (2-3 hours)
   - Remove duplicate server startup logic
   - Use either workflow manual start OR Playwright webServer (not both)
   - Add proper health check before running tests
   
3. **Re-enable Workflow** (1 hour)
   - Uncomment workflow triggers
   - Test on a feature branch first
   - Merge when stable
   
4. **Validation** (2-3 hours)
   - Run full E2E suite locally
   - Verify all 120+ tests pass
   - Test in CI environment
   - Monitor for flakiness

**Expected Outcome:** 
- E2E tests running automatically on PR and push
- 120+ tests passing consistently
- Improved confidence in deployments

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements (Phase 6)

### Service Layer Extraction

**Current State:**
- Business logic mixed with route handlers in `routes/*.py`
- Direct database access from routes
- Difficult to test business logic in isolation

**Target Architecture:**
```
routes/
  ‚îî‚îÄ> services/          (NEW)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> repositories/  (exists)
            ‚îî‚îÄ> database
```

**Implementation Plan (Week 7-8):**

1. **Create Service Layer** (8-10 hours)
   ```python
   services/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product_service.py    # Product business logic
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dish_service.py       # Dish business logic
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log_service.py        # Daily log business logic
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fasting_service.py    # Fasting business logic
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ statistics_service.py # Statistics calculations
   ```

2. **Refactor Routes** (4-6 hours)
   - Move business logic from routes to services
   - Routes become thin controllers
   - Validate input ‚Üí Call service ‚Üí Return response
   
3. **Update Tests** (6-8 hours)
   - Add service unit tests
   - Mock services in route tests
   - Improve test isolation

4. **Benefits:**
   - ‚úÖ Improved testability
   - ‚úÖ Better separation of concerns
   - ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and extend
   - ‚úÖ Follows SOLID principles

**Example Refactoring:**

**Before (route with business logic):**
```python
@products_bp.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.json
    # Business logic here
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    # Database operations
    # Calculations
    return jsonify(result)
```

**After (thin controller):**
```python
@products_bp.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.json
    result = product_service.create_product(data)
    return jsonify(result)
```

## üé® UX/UI Enhancement Plans

### Current UX State
- ‚úÖ Responsive design implemented
- ‚úÖ Dark theme available
