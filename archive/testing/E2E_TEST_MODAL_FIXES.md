# E2E Test Modal Fixes - Phase 1 Implementation

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Phase 1 Complete - Modal Timeout Issues Fixed  
**Related**: ISSUE_E2E_TEST_FIXES.md, E2E_TEST_FIXES.md

## Overview

Implemented Phase 1 of the E2E test fixes as outlined in ISSUE_E2E_TEST_FIXES.md. This phase focused on fixing modal timeout issues, which were identified as the PRIMARY issue affecting approximately 18 out of 28 failing tests.

## Problems Addressed

### Primary Issue: Modal Timeout Failures
- **Affected**: ~18 tests
- **Severity**: ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Root Cause**: 5-second timeout too short for CI environment
- **Impact**: 76.7% pass rate (target: >95%)

### Root Causes Identified
1. Default 5-second timeout insufficient for CI environment
2. CI runners are slower than local development
3. Modal animations take longer in CI
4. Network latency affects modal loading
5. No proper wait for modal animations and network idle state

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Modal Helper Functions

Created comprehensive modal interaction helpers in `tests/e2e-playwright/helpers/page-helpers.js`:

#### `waitForModal(page, options)`
**Purpose**: Wait for modal to be fully visible and ready for interaction

**Features**:
- 15-second default timeout (increased from 5s)
- Waits for modal backdrop (if present)
- Waits for modal element to be visible
- Waits for modal content to be fully loaded
- Waits 500ms for Bootstrap modal fade animation
- Waits for network to be idle (with fallback)

**Code**:
```javascript
async function waitForModal(page, options = {}) {
  const timeout = options.timeout || 15000; // Increased from 5s to 15s for CI
  
  // Wait for modal backdrop to appear
  try {
    await page.waitForSelector('.modal-backdrop', { 
      state: 'visible', 
      timeout: timeout 
    });
  } catch (e) {
    // Some modals may not have a backdrop, continue
  }
  
  // Wait for modal itself to be visible
  await page.waitForSelector('.modal:visible', { 
    timeout: timeout 
  });
  
  // Wait for modal content to be fully loaded
  await page.waitForSelector('.modal .modal-content', { 
    state: 'visible', 
    timeout: timeout 
  });
  
  // Wait for animations to complete
  await page.waitForTimeout(500);
  
  // Wait for network to be idle
  try {
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle', { timeout: 5000 });
  } catch (e) {
    // NetworkIdle may timeout in some cases, that's OK
  }
}
```

#### `closeModal(page, options)`
**Purpose**: Close modal and wait for it to disappear completely

**Features**:
- Tries multiple close button selectors
- Waits for modal to be hidden
- Waits for backdrop to disappear
- Waits for network to settle

#### `clickWhenReady(page, selector, options)`
**Purpose**: Click button only when it's visible and enabled

**Features**:
- 15-second default timeout
- Waits for element to be visible
- Waits for element to be enabled (not disabled)
- Waits for animations before clicking
- Handles loading states properly

#### `submitModalForm(page, options)`
**Purpose**: Submit form in modal with proper API wait

**Features**:
- Finds submit button using multiple selectors
- Waits for API response (or timeout for demo version)
- Waits for modal to close after submission
- Waits for network to settle
- Handles both Local (API) and Public (localStorage) versions

### 2. Increased Default Timeout

Updated `waitForElement` helper to use 15-second timeout:

**Before**:
```javascript
const timeout = options.timeout || 5000;
```

**After**:
```javascript
const timeout = options.timeout || 15000; // Increased from 5s to 15s for CI
```

### 3. Updated Test Files

#### smoke.spec.js
- Replaced `page.waitForSelector('.modal:visible', { timeout: 5000 })` with `helpers.waitForModal(page)`
- Increased expect timeout to 15 seconds

#### product-workflow.spec.js
- Updated 3 modal interactions to use `helpers.waitForModal(page)`
- Replaced manual submit button logic with `helpers.submitModalForm(page)`
- Increased all modal-related timeouts to 15 seconds

#### logging-workflow.spec.js
- Updated modal wait in log entry creation
- Replaced manual submit logic with `helpers.submitModalForm(page)`

- Total: 2 lines modified

### 3. `tests/e2e-playwright/product-workflow.spec.js`
**Changes**:
- Updated 4 tests to use new modal helpers:
  - `should create a new product` - uses `waitForModal` and `submitModalForm`
  - `should validate product form` - uses `waitForModal`
  - `should calculate keto index` - uses `waitForModal`
- Total: 12 lines modified

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run specific test
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "modal"

# Run with headed mode to see what's happening
npm run test:e2e -- --headed --grep "modal"

# Run all product workflow tests
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e-playwright/product-workflow.spec.js
```

### CI Testing
1. Trigger E2E workflow manually via workflow_dispatch
2. Monitor results in GitHub Actions
3. Download artifacts if tests still fail
4. Adjust timeouts if needed

## Technical Details

### Why 15 Seconds?
- CI environments are typically 2-3x slower than local
- Original 5s timeout Ã— 3 = 15s provides adequate buffer
- Network idle wait adds additional safety
- Still reasonable for test execution time

### Why waitForLoadState('networkidle')?
- Ensures all AJAX requests complete
- Prevents clicking on modals that are still loading data
- Handles both API-based and localStorage-based versions
- Has fallback timeout to prevent hanging

### Why Multiple Submit Button Selectors?
- Different pages use different button structures
- Demo version vs Local version may differ
- Increases test robustness across implementations
- Follows Page Object Pattern best practices

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Creating reusable helper functions instead of inline fixes
2. Increasing timeouts liberally for CI
3. Adding proper animation waits
4. Using networkidle for API completion

### What to Watch Out For
1. NetworkIdle may timeout on some pages - needs fallback
2. Modal backdrop not always present - needs try/catch
3. Different button text across implementations - needs multiple selectors
4. Demo version has no API - needs conditional logic

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use 15s+ timeouts in CI
2. Wait for animations to complete (500ms)
3. Wait for network idle after modal actions
4. Use helper functions for complex interactions
5. Handle both Local and Public versions gracefully
