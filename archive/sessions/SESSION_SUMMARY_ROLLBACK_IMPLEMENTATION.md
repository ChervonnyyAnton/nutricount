    └─ Input: target_commit (optional)
    
Validate Job
    ├─ Determine target commit
    ├─ Check rollback history (loop prevention)
    ├─ Validate target age
    └─ Output: should_proceed, target_commit

Rollback Job (if validated)
    ├─ Checkout target commit
    ├─ Create version files (with rollback metadata)
    ├─ Deploy to GitHub Pages
    └─ Display summary

Smoke Test Job
    ├─ Wait for propagation (30s)
    ├─ Test demo accessibility
    ├─ Verify version file
    └─ Report results

Create Incident Issue
    ├─ Create GitHub issue
    ├─ Add rollback details
    ├─ Tag appropriately
    ├─ Assign to initiator
    └─ Provide resolution checklist
```

### Safety Guards Implemented

**1. Rollback Loop Prevention**
```yaml
# Checks GitHub API for recent rollbacks
# Blocks if >3 rollbacks in last hour
# Prevents automated rollback loops
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents infinite loops
- ✅ Forces investigation after multiple failures
- ✅ Protects from misconfiguration

**2. Target Age Validation**
```yaml
# Calculates days since target commit
# Warns if >30 days old
# Allows proceed with warning
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents accidental old version deployment
- ✅ Highlights missing features/security patches
- ✅ Encourages consideration of alternatives

**3. Post-Rollback Smoke Tests**
```yaml
# Tests demo accessibility
# Verifies version file
# Reports success/failure
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Confirms rollback succeeded
- ✅ Detects if target version also broken
- ✅ Provides immediate feedback

2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Fill in:
   - Reason: "E2E tests failing after deployment"
   - Target commit: (leave empty)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. Verify rollback in workflow summary
7. Check incident issue created

2. Go to rollback workflow
3. Run workflow with:
   - Reason: "Rollback to last week's stable version"
   - Target commit: "abc1234"
4. Review validation warnings (if any)
5. Wait for completion
6. Verify version

**Result**:
- Demo rolled back to specific commit
- Age warning displayed (if >30 days)
- Rollback metadata captured
- Incident issue with details

### Example 3: Emergency Manual Rollback

**Scenario**: Rollback workflow failing, need immediate revert

**Steps** (from runbook):
1. `git checkout abc1234`
2. `gh workflow run deploy-demo.yml --ref abc1234`
3. `gh run watch`
4. Create incident issue manually

## 💡 Learnings & Insights

### 1. Comprehensive Design Pays Off

**Insight**: Taking 2 hours to design properly saved time in implementation

**Evidence**:
- Clear architecture from day 1
- No redesign needed during implementation
- All edge cases considered upfront

**Takeaway**: Don't skip design phase, especially for critical infrastructure

### 2. Safety Guards Are Essential

**Insight**: Loop prevention and age validation prevent mistakes

**Why It Matters**:
- Rollback loops can cause outages
- Old versions may have vulnerabilities
- Guards provide "pause and think" moments

**Implementation**:
- Added loop prevention (3/hour limit)
- Added age warning (>30 days)
- Both can be overridden with caution

### 3. Documentation Quality Matters

**Insight**: Runbook quality is as important as code quality

**Evidence**:
- 500+ lines of operational procedures
- Step-by-step guides
- Troubleshooting sections
- Emergency procedures

**Value**:
- Anyone can perform rollback
- Reduces stress during incidents
- Faster mean time to recovery

### 4. Automation + Manual Balance

**Insight**: Need both automated and manual rollback options

**Rationale**:
- Automated: Fast response to detected failures
- Manual: Handles edge cases and human judgment

**Implementation**:
- Manual workflow (Phase 3) ✅
- Automated trigger (Phase 4) ⏳
- Emergency manual (documented) ✅
