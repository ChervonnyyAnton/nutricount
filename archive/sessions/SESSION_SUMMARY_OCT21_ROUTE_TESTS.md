**Response Format Correction:**
```python
# Before (incorrect):
assert data['success'] is True

# After (correct):
assert data['status'] == 'success'
```

**Linting Fix:**
- Removed unused `pytest` import
- Zero linting errors in new file

### 4. Validation (30 minutes)

**Full Test Suite:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
# Result: 605/605 passed in 27.85s ✅
```

**Coverage Check:**
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov=routes
# Result: 87% overall
# routes/fasting.py: 76% (was 55%)
```
