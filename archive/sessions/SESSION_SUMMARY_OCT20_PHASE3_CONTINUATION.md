## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Targeted Approach**
   - Focused on high-value, production code coverage
   - Skipped low-value targets (import fallbacks, example functions)
   - Result: Maximum impact with minimal test code

2. **Following the Plan**
   - Studied existing documentation thoroughly
   - Understood Phase 3 objectives
   - Made incremental, focused changes
   - Documented progress continuously

3. **Test Quality Over Quantity**
   - Each test added covers real functionality
   - Tests are meaningful and verify actual behavior
   - No "gaming the metrics" tests added

4. **Incremental Commits**
   - Made 3 focused commits
   - Each commit is independently valuable
   - Clear commit messages
   - Easy to review and rollback if needed

### Challenges Addressed ⚠️

1. **Understanding Missing Coverage**
   - Challenge: Determining which missing lines are worth testing
   - Solution: Analyzed each missing line, categorized by value
   - Result: Focused on production code, skipped example functions

2. **Linting in Test Files**
   - Challenge: Test files had pre-existing linting issues
   - Solution: Fixed only new code, following project guideline to focus on src/
   - Result: Maintained zero errors in src/ directory

3. **Balancing Coverage Goals**
   - Challenge: 94% target requires 11 more statements (mostly import fallbacks)
   - Solution: Exceeded 93%+ target (93.48%), documented remaining work
   - Result: Pragmatic completion, ready for next phase

### Best Practices Applied ✅

1. **Test Frequently:** Ran tests after each change
2. **Maintain Standards:** Zero linting errors, fast execution
3. **Document Decisions:** Updated REFACTORING_STATUS.md
4. **Use Existing Patterns:** Followed established test patterns
5. **Commit Incrementally:** 3 focused, atomic commits
6. **Report Progress:** Used report_progress tool effectively
