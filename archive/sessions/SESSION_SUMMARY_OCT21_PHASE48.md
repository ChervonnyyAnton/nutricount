### 4. Iterative Refinement (1 hour)

**Issue 1: Response Format**
- Initial tests used wrong response key (`success` instead of `status`)
- Fixed by checking actual `json_response` function implementation
- Updated all tests to use correct format

**Issue 2: Dish Creation**
- Initial tests used wrong ingredient field (`quantity` instead of `quantity_grams`)
- Fixed by reviewing validate_dish_data function
- Updated dish creation in both log tests

**Issue 3: Task Manager Connection**
- Initial tests tried to connect to actual Redis/Celery
- Fixed by adding proper mocking with unittest.mock.patch
- All task tests now mock external dependencies

**Issue 4: Unused Imports**
- Linting found unused imports (json, sqlite3, MagicMock, pytest)
- Removed all unused imports
- Final linting: 0 errors ✅

**Final Validation:**
```bash
# New tests: 27/27 passed (1 skipped)
# Full suite: 642/642 passed (1 skipped) in 29.37s ✅
# Linting: 0 errors ✅
# Log coverage: 75% → 91% (+16%) ✅
