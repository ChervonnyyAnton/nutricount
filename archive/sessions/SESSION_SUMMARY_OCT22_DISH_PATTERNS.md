## 🔧 Technical Work Completed

### 1. DishRepository Implementation (3 hours)

**Created:** `repositories/dish_repository.py` (407 lines)

#### Core Methods Implemented:
1. **find_all()** - Get all dishes with pre-calculated nutrition
   - Aggregates data from dishes and dish_ingredients tables
   - Calculates total calories, protein, fat, carbs, net carbs
   - Orders by name (case-insensitive)

2. **find_by_id(dish_id)** - Get dish by ID with ingredients
   - Returns complete dish data with nutrition
   - Includes all ingredients with product names
   - Returns None if not found

3. **find_by_name(name)** - Find dish by exact name
   - Used for duplicate checking
   - Returns basic dish info or None

4. **create(data)** - Create new dish with ingredients and calculations
   - Inserts dish and ingredients
   - Processes each ingredient with preparation methods
   - Calculates recipe nutrition using RecipeIngredient
   - Calculates keto index and category
   - Updates dish with all calculated values
   - Returns complete created dish

5. **update(dish_id, data)** - Update existing dish
   - Updates basic info (name, description)
   - Replaces ingredients if provided
   - Recalculates nutrition if ingredients changed
   - Returns updated dish or None

6. **delete(dish_id)** - Delete dish and ingredients
   - Deletes ingredients first (CASCADE)
   - Deletes dish
   - Returns success boolean

7. **Helper Methods:**
   - `exists(dish_id)` - Check if dish exists
   - `count()` - Count total dishes
   - `is_used_in_logs(dish_id)` - Check log usage
   - `verify_products_exist(product_ids)` - Verify all products exist

#### Technical Details:
- Uses sqlite3.Row (converts to dict where needed)
- Integrates with nutrition_calculator for recipe calculations
- Handles KETO_INDEX_CATEGORIES for keto classification
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Transaction management with commit

#### Key Learnings:
1. **Recipe Calculation Structure:**
   - Returns dict with keys: `recipe_name`, `servings`, `weights`, `nutrition_per_100g`, etc.
   - `weights` contains: `total_raw`, `total_cooked`, `yield_factor`
   - `nutrition_per_100g` contains: `calories`, `protein`, `fats`, `carbs`, `net_carbs`, etc.
   
2. **sqlite3.Row Handling:**
   - sqlite3.Row doesn't have `.get()` method
   - Must convert to dict: `product = dict(product_row)`
   - Then can use: `product.get("key", default)`

---

   - Falls back to repository if cache miss
   - Caches result for 5 minutes (300s TTL)

2. **get_dish_by_id(dish_id)** - Get single dish
   - Simple delegation to repository

3. **create_dish(data)** - Create with validation and business rules
   - Validates data with validate_dish_data()
   - **Business rule:** No duplicate names
   - **Business rule:** All products must exist
   - Creates dish via repository
   - Invalidates cache on success
   - Returns (success, dish, errors) tuple

4. **update_dish(dish_id, data)** - Update with business rules
   - Checks if dish exists
   - Validates data if provided
   - **Business rule:** No name conflicts with other dishes
   - **Business rule:** All products must exist (if ingredients provided)
   - Updates via repository
   - Invalidates cache on success
   - Returns (success, dish, errors) tuple

5. **delete_dish(dish_id)** - Delete with business rules
   - Checks if dish exists
   - **Business rule:** Cannot delete if used in logs
   - Deletes via repository
   - Invalidates cache on success
   - Returns (success, errors) tuple

6. **get_dish_count()** - Get total count
   - Simple delegation to repository

#### Business Rules Enforced:
1. ✅ No duplicate dish names
2. ✅ All products in ingredients must exist
3. ✅ Cannot delete dish if used in log entries
4. ✅ Name cannot conflict with other dishes when updating
5. ✅ Input validation required for all operations

#### Technical Details:

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Pattern Reusability**
   - DishRepository/Service followed ProductRepository/Service exactly
   - Same test structure, same mocking strategy
   - Consistent naming and organization
   - Easy to understand and maintain

2. **Test-Driven Approach**
   - Found bugs early (sqlite3.Row issue, recipe calculation keys)
   - 100% coverage from the start
   - Fast feedback loop

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 40 tests provide excellent coverage
   - Mock-based testing is fast and reliable
   - Each layer tested independently
   - All business rules verified

4. **SOLID Principles**
   - Applying all 5 principles from the start
   - Code is highly maintainable
   - Easy to extend without breaking existing code

### Technical Challenges Solved ✅

1. **sqlite3.Row Object Handling**
   - **Problem:** sqlite3.Row doesn't have `.get()` method
   - **Solution:** Convert to dict first: `product = dict(product_row)`
   - **Impact:** Code now handles optional fields correctly

2. **Recipe Calculation Keys**
   - **Problem:** Wrong keys used (total_raw_weight vs weights.total_raw)
   - **Solution:** Tested actual function output, used correct structure
   - **Impact:** Repository now correctly stores calculated values

3. **Empty Ingredients List**
   - **Problem:** verify_products_exist() called with empty list
   - **Solution:** Repository handles empty list case
   - **Impact:** Service can update dish without ingredients

### Best Practices Applied ✅

1. **Testing**: TDD, AAA pattern, descriptive names, 100% coverage
2. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings, inline comments where needed
3. **Quality**: Linting, formatting, no regressions, 100% pass rate
4. **Progress Tracking**: Regular commits, detailed PR descriptions
5. **Validation**: Verified all tests pass after each change
