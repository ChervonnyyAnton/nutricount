# üó∫Ô∏è Integrated Roadmap: Refactoring + Unified Architecture

## Overview

This roadmap integrates two parallel workstreams:
1. **Refactoring Track**: Continue existing refactoring work (testing, mutation testing, architecture improvements)
2. **Unified Architecture Track**: Build Local + Public versions with shared codebase

Both tracks work in parallel without blocking each other.

- **Integration points**: Weekly sync, ensure compatibility

### Dependencies
```
Refactoring Track Dependencies:
- None (independent work)

Unified Architecture Track Dependencies:
- Week 1: None
- Week 2: Adapters need API contract (document, don't change)
- Week 3: Tests need both tracks functional
- Week 4-6: CI/CD needs all pieces working
```

## üö¶ Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Time Overrun**
   - Mitigation: Weekly checkpoints, adjust priorities
   - Contingency: Extend timeline, focus on MVP

2. **Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Keep existing code working, parallel development
   - Contingency: Feature flags, gradual rollout

3. **Test Failures**
   - Mitigation: Continuous testing, early detection
   - Contingency: Fix immediately, don't accumulate

4. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Weekly integration tests, early alignment
   - Contingency: Buffer time in weeks 4-5
