# 🗺️ Integrated Roadmap: Refactoring + Unified Architecture

## Overview

This roadmap integrates three parallel workstreams:
1. **Refactoring Track**: Continue existing refactoring work (testing, mutation testing, architecture improvements)
2. **Unified Architecture Track**: Build Local + Public versions with shared codebase
3. **Educational & FOSS Track**: Expand educational value for all IT roles and build FOSS health solution

All tracks work in parallel without blocking each other.

### Mission Expansion 🎯

**Educational Platform:** From developers only → QA, PO, PM, DevOps, UX/UI Designers  
**FOSS Health Tracker:** Complete, privacy-focused nutrition tracker for keto followers

See [EDUCATIONAL_EXPANSION_PLAN.md](EDUCATIONAL_EXPANSION_PLAN.md) for detailed plan.
