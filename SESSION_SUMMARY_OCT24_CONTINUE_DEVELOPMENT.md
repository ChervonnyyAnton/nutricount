## 📚 Learnings & Insights

### 1. Documentation vs Implementation Gap
**Finding**: E2E_TEST_FIXES.md documented fixes that weren't applied  
**Lesson**: Always validate that documented changes are actually in the code  
**Action**: Created validation document to confirm all fixes applied

### 2. Service Layer Complexity
**Finding**: FastingService more complex than expected (schema issues)  
**Lesson**: Not all services integrate easily, need careful analysis  
**Action**: Documented status and created roadmap for completion

### 3. Incremental Progress
**Finding**: Multiple small commits with clear progress tracking works well  
**Lesson**: Break work into phases, commit frequently, update progress  
**Action**: Used 4 commits with clear messages and progress updates

### 4. Test Validation is Critical
**Finding**: All 844 tests passing throughout all changes  
**Lesson**: Frequent test runs catch regressions immediately  
**Action**: Ran tests after each phase to ensure no breakage
