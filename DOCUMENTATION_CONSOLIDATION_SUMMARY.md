## üéì Best Practices Established

### Documentation Organization
1. **Core docs in root** - Essential, actively maintained documentation
2. **Role-specific in docs/** - Organized by user role
3. **Historical in archive/** - Preserved but not actively maintained
4. **Clear naming** - Descriptive, consistent file names

### Link Management
1. **Relative links** - Use relative paths for internal links
2. **Archive references** - Point to archive/ with clear labels
3. **Regular verification** - Check links after structure changes
4. **Cross-references** - Maintain bidirectional links where appropriate

### Content Guidelines
1. **Current information** - Only current implementation details in core docs
2. **Historical context** - Move outdated info to archive
3. **No duplication** - Single source of truth for each topic
4. **Clear purpose** - Each document serves a specific audience

## üìù Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Core Documentation
- After major feature releases
- When architecture changes
- After significant refactoring
- When adding new roles/guides
- Monthly documentation review

### When to Archive Documents
- Session summaries after completion
- Status reports after superseded
- Planning docs after implementation
- Phase docs after completion
- Outdated analysis documents

### Archive Policy
- **Preserve, don't delete** - All documentation is valuable
- **Organize clearly** - Use consistent structure
- **Document context** - Add README files for each archive section
- **Link appropriately** - Reference from core docs when needed
