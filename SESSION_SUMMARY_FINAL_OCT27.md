## üéØ Key Findings

### Environment Constraints
**Cannot be done in CI/CD container:**
1. ‚ùå E2E test validation (requires GitHub Actions UI access)
2. ‚ùå Mutation testing Phase 2 (requires 8-12 hours in local environment)

**Can be done in CI/CD container:**
1. ‚úÖ Test validation (done - 844 passing)
2. ‚úÖ Code quality checks (done - 0 errors)
3. ‚úÖ Documentation creation (done - 2 new docs)
4. ‚úÖ Tool validation (done - script tested)

### Optimal Next Steps
Based on analysis, the optimal approach is:
1. **Today:** E2E validation (1-2 hours) via GitHub Actions UI
2. **This week:** Review E2E results, re-enable if successful
3. **Next week:** Mutation testing Phase 2 (8-12 hours over 3 days)
