## Critical Issues Found

### üî¥ Priority 1: Architectural Inconsistencies

#### Issue 1.1: Repository Initialization Pattern Mismatch
**Location**: `repositories/` directory
**Impact**: High - Affects testability and maintainability

**Problem**:
```python
# ProductRepository & DishRepository (correct):
repository = ProductRepository(db)  # Takes connection object

# FastingRepository & LogRepository (incorrect):
repository = FastingRepository(Config.DATABASE)  # Takes string path
```

**Why it matters**:
- Violates Dependency Injection principle
- Creates new connections for every repository call
- Inconsistent with BaseRepository interface
- Makes unit testing harder
- Potential connection leak issues

**Affected Files**:
- `repositories/fasting_repository.py`
- `repositories/log_repository.py`
- `routes/fasting.py` (line 30)
- `routes/log.py` (line 27)

**Recommendation**: Standardize all repositories to accept `db` connection object

---

#### Issue 1.2: Database Connection Management
**Impact**: Medium - Potential resource leaks

**Problem**:
- Some routes properly close connections in `finally` blocks (13 instances)
- Service layer routes don't explicitly close connections
- No centralized cleanup mechanism

**Affected Files**:
- `routes/fasting.py` (no db.close())
- `routes/log.py` (no db.close())
- Multiple other routes

**Recommendation**: Implement `@app.teardown_appcontext` decorator for automatic cleanup

---

#### Issue 1.3: Two Data Access Patterns
**Impact**: Medium - Codebase inconsistency

**Problem**:
- Some routes use `get_db()` helper directly
- Others use service layer with `db_path` string
- Inconsistent approach makes refactoring harder

**Recommendation**: Standardize on service layer pattern with proper dependency injection

---

### üü¢ Priority 2: Minor Issues (Previously Priority 3)

#### Issue 2.1: Demo Directory Missing
**Problem**: README extensively documents `/demo/` folder but it doesn't exist
**Fix**: Remove demo references or create the standalone demo version

**Note**: Playwright E2E tests (120 tests) were removed from the project due to persistent GUI inconsistency issues. The project now relies on 45 Python E2E tests that provide comprehensive API workflow coverage.

#### Issue 2.2: Formatting Bug in constants.py
**Location**: `src/constants.py:38`
```python
"dish_deleted": "XX‚úÖ Dish deleted successfully!XX",  # Should be just ‚úÖ
```
**Fix**: Simple string correction

#### Issue 2.3: Frontend Tests Not Runnable
**Problem**: `frontend/` has tests but `npm install` hasn't been run
**Fix**: Add frontend test running to CI/CD pipeline

#### Issue 2.4: Hardcoded Demo Credentials
**Location**: `routes/auth.py`
**Problem**: Contains hardcoded "admin"/"admin123"
**Fix**: Move to environment variables or configuration

---

3. Test connection lifecycle
4. Monitor for connection leaks

**Implementation**:
```python
@app.teardown_appcontext
def close_db(error):
